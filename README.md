# Project Report: Analysis of Global Economic Indicators
# Overview
This project explores relationships between various economic and health indicators across different countries and regions as of the year 2014. The analysis leverages data from the World Bank and Human Development Index (HDI) to examine how life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population metrics interrelate. The primary focus is to visualize the data effectively, providing insights into how different regions of the world compare across these parameters.

# Data Sources
World Bank Data: Includes economic metrics like GDP, GDP per capita, population figures, and more.
Human Development Index (HDI): Provides a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators to rank countries into four tiers of human development.
Key Indicators Analyzed
Life Expectancy at Birth
GDP per Capita (USD)
Population (Millions)
Human Development Index (HDI)
Electricity Consumption (kWh per capita)
# Visualizations
GDP Growth Over Time by Region: A stacked area plot showing the growth in GDP over time across different regions.

Population Growth Over Time by Region: Similar to the GDP growth plot, this visualization tracks population changes over time.
Life Expectancy vs. GDP Per Capita: A scatter plot illustrating the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita.
HDI by Region: A bar chart showing the average Human Development Index for different world regions.
Correlation Heatmap: Displays the correlation between life expectancy and GDP per capita.
Electricity Consumption vs. GDP Per Capita: A scatter plot showing how electricity consumption correlates with GDP per capita, colored by HDI.
Conclusions
The analysis highlights significant disparities in economic and health outcomes across different regions. For instance, regions with higher GDP per capita generally exhibit higher life expectancy and HDI. Additionally, the correlation between electricity consumption and GDP suggests that energy usage is an essential factor in economic development.
